- ðŸ¤– **Hybrid Control Architecture**: Combines behavior-based and formation control approaches
- ðŸ“¡ **Communication Jamming Simulation**: Models realistic communication disruptions
- ðŸ§  **LLM Integration**: Incorporates Large Language Models for high-level decision making
- ðŸŽ¯ **Formation Control**: Advanced algorithms for maintaining swarm formations
- ðŸ”„ **Adaptive Behavior**: Agents that can adapt to changing communication conditions
- ðŸ“Š **Real-time Visualization**: Interactive GUI for monitoring swarm behavior
- ðŸ”¬ **Research-Oriented**: Built for academic research and experimental studies

## Quick Start

For most users, getting started with Swarm Squad Episode I is as simple as:

```bash
# Install Swarm Squad Episode I
uv pip install swarm-squad-ep1

# Run the application
swarm-squad-ep1
swarm-squad-ep1 --help
```

That's it! The application will start and you can begin exploring communication-challenged multi-agent systems.

## Prerequisites

For basic usage, you only need:

- **[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)**: For package installation and management (recommended)

### Installing uv

If you don't have uv installed, you can install it using:

```bash
# macOS/Linux
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Windows
powershell -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

## Installation

### Option 1: Install from PyPI (Recommended)

The simplest way to install Swarm Squad Episode I is directly from PyPI:

```bash
# Install the package using uv
uv pip install swarm-squad-ep1
```

### Option 2: Development Installation

For contributors, developers, or if you plan to modify the framework:

**Additional Prerequisites for Development:**

- **[git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)**: For cloning the repository
- **[ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/)**: For code linting and formatting
- **[pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/)**: For code quality hooks

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Sang-Buster/Swarm-Squad-Ep1
cd Swarm-Squad-Ep1

# Option 1 (Recommended): Synchronize environment with dependencies
uv sync
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
# Or: .venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows

# Option 2 (Manual): Create virtual environment manually
uv venv --python 3.10
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
# Or: .venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
uv pip install -e .
```

## Running Swarm Squad Episode I

After installation, you can run Swarm Squad Episode I using the command-line interface:

```bash
# Run with default settings
swarm-squad-ep1

# Show available options and help
swarm-squad-ep1 --help
```

## Development Setup

If you're planning to develop or extend Swarm Squad Episode I, set up the development environment:

### Install Development Tools

```bash
# Install development dependencies
uv pip install ruff pre-commit
```

### Set up Git Hooks

```bash
# Install git hooks for code quality
pre-commit install --install-hooks
```

These hooks perform different checks at various stages:

- **`commit-msg`**: Ensures commit messages follow the conventional format
- **`pre-commit`**: Runs Ruff linting and formatting checks before each commit
- **`pre-push`**: Performs final validation before pushing to remote

### Code Quality Checks

```bash
# Run linting and formatting
ruff check --fix
ruff check --select I --fix
ruff format
```

### Running from Source

When developing, you can run directly from the source code:

```bash
uv run src/swarm_squad_ep1/main.py
```
