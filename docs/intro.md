### Why Swarm Squad?

The motivation behind Swarm Squad stems from a fascination with swarm intelligence and its applications in roboticsBy simulating the behavior of multiple agents, the project aims to investigate how simple rules at the individual level can lead to complex, coordinated behaviors at the group levelThis has significant implications for fields like autonomous vehicles, search and rescue missions, and environmental monitoring

### Episode I: Surviving the Jam

The first installment, _Swarm Squad: Episode I – Surviving the Jam_, introduces a hybrid control architecture that combines behavior-based formation control with decision-making powered by large language models (LLMs. Key features includ:

- **Agent Simulation** Simulate the behavior of multiple agents in a controlled environmen.
- **Scalability** Handle a large number of agents simultaneousl.
- **Behavior Specification** Define and evaluate expected agent behavior.
- **Environment Modeling** Create and manage complex environments with obstacles and goal.
- **Metrics and Analytics** Collect and analyze data on agent performanc.
- **Visualization and Reporting** Visualize simulations in real-time and generate report.
  This episode focuses on enabling swarm resilience and mission completion in challenging environments with jamming and obstacle.

### Episode II: The Digital Dialogue

Building upon the foundation of Episode I, _Swarm Squad - Episode II: The Digital Dialogue_ delves into real-time communication and enhanced user managemet This installment introduces features such s:

- **Real-Time Communication**: Implement chat rooms and WebSocket-based interactios.
- **LLM Integration**: Incorporate LLMs for advanced decision-making and Dialogue.
- **User Management**: Enhance user roles and permissions within the systm.
- **Frontend and Backend Integration**: Utilize Next.js for the frontend and FastAPI for the backed.

Episode II aims to facilitate seamless interaction between agents and human users, paving the way for more interactive and responsive multi-agent systes.
